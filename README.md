# TweetFall

This project is a React-based web application that displays Twitter contents in a waterfall style. Since Twitter's recommendation system almost breaks due to layoffs, Twitter web and iOS applications are flooded with NONSENSE ads and boring tweets. As my first step, I design a web-based application to develop my own recommendation system (without ML) and will further extend its features, e.g., mutli-platform support and ml support.
